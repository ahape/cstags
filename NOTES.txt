So it looks like the C# extension from Omnisharp connects to a locally running
Omnisharp application, and broadcasts messages (as low-level packets) back and
forth to the Omnisharp process.

PacketCommand is what is sent with each (?) message to the server. The server
responds with that command type and a sequence ID.

The server URL for _something_ is https://roslynomnisharp.blob.core.windows.net
The version info path is https://roslynomnisharp.blob.core.windows.net/releases/versioninfo.txt

Looks like Omnisharp can be installed as a Vim Plugin here
https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vim

It looks like the Omnisharp server can be found/downloaded here
https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn

How Vim tags work:
^]              - Jump to function definition
g]              - List all of the tag matches
^t              - Return to previous location after a tag jump
:tag /<pattern> - list all tags matching a specified pattern

In Roslyn, I think this class is used for extracting a basic method:
SourceOrdinaryMethodSymbol

This class is used for determining the MEANING behind the parsed syntax tokens
